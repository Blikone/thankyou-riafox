            Dear Ben,
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Thank you so much for giving me the chance to interview with you over the last two weeks. Every piece of advice I received
            regarding the interview process directed me to be as genuine as I possibly could, so that's what I endeavoured
            to do. I have a friend with experience working in several different types of workplace culture, and he attested
            to me how vital it is that the atmosphere at work be one in which you can personally thrive. I was therefore
            elated to find out during my first visit to your office that you felt like I would mesh well with the rest of
            the team. I have none of the trepidation that would have come had I put up a front during the interview and felt
            the subsequent pressure to keep up that fa√ßade ever after.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            I was excited to come back for the technical interview as well. Thank you again for accommodating me and my present schedule.
            I had a great time problem solving and talking with you about encorporating function modules into bigger applications,
            and how then those applications are designed and altered for customer use. I felt again like I represented my
            skills and understanding accurately, and even though it was uncomfortable I'm glad you had the chance to see
            me have to search for answers a little bit. I doubt I'll forget how a for...in loop works ever again.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            You have been so warm and open with me ever since our first meeting in November. That, more than anything else, has excited
            me about the prospect of working at Riafox as I've talked with you over the last two months.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            I appreciate all the time and consideration you've given me, and look forward to hearing your decision about the internship.
        </p>
        <p class="closure">Yours,</p>
